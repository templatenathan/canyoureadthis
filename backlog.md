As a pilot
I want to convert sentances to the Nato phonetic alphabet
So that I can communicate sentences clearly in the alphabet

âœ…
GIVEN each individual letter
WHEN converted
THEN the code word for the letter should be provided

âœ…
GIVEN a whole word
WHEN converted
THEN each letter should be converted, with a space in between

ðŸš§
GIVEN a sentence with the punctuation marks (',', '.', '!', '?')
WHEN converted
THEN each punctuation mark should be perserved
AND spaces should be removed
